This repository contains a process scheduler implementation written in pure C. The process scheduler is a crucial component of an operating system kernel, responsible for managing the execution of processes by allocating CPU time and resources among them.
The process scheduler in this repository is designed as an educational project for an operating systems class. It aims to provide students with a practical understanding of process scheduling algorithms and their implementation details.
